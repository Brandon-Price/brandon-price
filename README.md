# Currently a work in progress

Current portfolio: https://brandon-price.github.io/Engineering_Portfolio <br>

The new repo brandon-price, will replace my current portfolio and will still be hosted on github pages. <br>
For the brandon-price repo I still need to work on the following:
- Next steps to be finished are finalizing the general theme of the page. i.e colors and background.
- Making the page more responsive to size of screen currently only really supporting standard size desktop screens.

Current projects that I am working on:
- uAuth: creating a user authentication system to better learn express and nodejs as well as learning authentication practices and principles.
- to-do: a simple to-do app where I can practice postgres and work on my frontend skills like html and css more (aesthetic practice). I will most likely be trying to cram nextjs as well to give myself a reason to work on it.
