# Currently a work in progress

Portfolio Link: https://brandon-price.github.io/brandon-price/ <br>

The new repo brandon-price, will replace my current portfolio and will still be hosted on github pages. <br>
I will be updating it periodically when I complete more projects or at least closer to completion.

Current projects that I am working on:
- uAuth: creating a user authentication system to better learn express and nodejs as well as learning authentication practices and principles.
- to-do: a simple to-do app where I can practice postgres and work on my frontend skills like html and css more (aesthetic practice). I will most likely be trying to cram nextjs as well to give myself a reason to work on it. (tentative I may do a different project this is kind of boring)
